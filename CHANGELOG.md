|-----------|------------|---------------------|-------------------|-------------|
| Optimize-FileNames | 1,000 | ~17 min | ~4 min | 4.25x |
| Convert-ToWebM | 100 | ~25 min | ~6 min | 4.17x |
| Convert-ToWebP | 500 | ~8 min | ~2 min | 4x |

### Fixed
- Memory leaks when processing very large directories
- Path tracking issues with nested directory renames
- Progress calculation accuracy for chunked operations
- ThreadJob module import errors in certain environments

### Technical Details

#### New Parameters Added
- `[switch]$GenerateReport` - Create preview reports
- `[string]$ReportPath` - Custom report output path
- `[string]$UndoLogPath` - Save undo information
- `[switch]$Parallel` - Enable parallel processing
- `[int]$ThrottleLimit` - Thread count (1-32)
- `[int]$ChunkSize` - Items per chunk (100-50,000)
- `[switch]$EnableProgressEstimation` - Enhanced progress

## Upgrade Guide

### From v1.5.x to v1.6.0

1. **No breaking changes** - All existing scripts will continue to work
2. **New features are opt-in** - Use new parameters to enable:
   ```powershell
   # Enable parallel processing
   Optimize-FileNames -Root "D:\Assets" -Parallel
   
   # Generate reports
   Optimize-FileNames -Root "D:\Assets" -GenerateReport
   
   # Create undo logs
   Optimize-FileNames -Root "D:\Assets" -UndoLogPath "undo.json"
   ```
3. **PowerShell 7 recommended** for parallel processing features
4. **Memory improvements** automatic with chunked processing
